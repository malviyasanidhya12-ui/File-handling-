# File-handling-
This Python program performs **CRUD operations** on files and folders using the `pathlib`, `os`, and `shutil` modules. It allows users to create, read, update (rename or modify), and delete files or directories through a simple menu-driven interface, providing an easy way to manage the file system interactively.
